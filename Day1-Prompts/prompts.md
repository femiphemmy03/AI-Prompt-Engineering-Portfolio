## Prompt 2: Social Media Strategy
**Prompt**: "Act as a marketing expert and generate a 5-point social media strategy for a small bakery."
**Output**: Certainly, Oluwafemi! Here's a 5-point social media strategy tailored for a small bakery, designed to increase visibility, build community, and drive sales—especially ideal if you're helping a local business or testing ideas for FemBlog’s outreach strategies too.

✅ 1. Tell Your Bakery’s Story Through Content Themes
Why it matters: People connect with people, not just products.

How to apply:

Post behind-the-scenes content (mixing dough, decorating cakes, morning setup).

Introduce the team with fun bios (“Meet the Baker Monday”).

Share your origin story: Why did you start baking? What inspires your flavors?

✅ 2. Use High-Quality Visuals & Reels to Tempt Taste Buds
Why it matters: Food is visual—great images sell.

How to apply:

Invest in good lighting and phone photography (natural light + portrait mode).

Post close-up shots, slow-motion frosting videos, and time-lapse bakes.

Use Instagram Reels and TikTok trends to show your best sellers or “How It’s Made” segments.

✅ 3. Promote Specials, Events, and Limited-Time Offers Creatively
Why it matters: Urgency drives action.

How to apply:

Use countdown stickers for new product drops.

Run “Flavor of the Week” or “Early Bird Deals.”

Share upcoming markets, pop-ups, or custom cake deadlines.

✅ 4. Build Community Through Engagement & User-Generated Content (UGC)
Why it matters: Word-of-mouth via social builds trust.

How to apply:

Encourage happy customers to tag you or share photos using a custom hashtag (e.g., #SweetBitesLagos).

Repost stories and testimonials.

Ask fun questions: “Cookies or cupcakes?” “What’s your dream birthday cake flavor?”

✅ 5. Stay Consistent with a Weekly Posting Schedule
Why it matters: Consistency = credibility + better reach.

How to apply:

Plan posts with a simple content calendar (e.g., Canva, Trello, or Notion).

Mix formats: 3 posts/week (1 product, 1 story, 1 behind-the-scenes).

Automate using free tools like Buffer, Later, or Meta Business Suite.]
**Notes**: Used role-based prompting to simulate a professional scenario.

## Prompt 3: Introduction to Prompt Engineering
**Prompt**: "Explain me what is prompt engineering like I'm 5."
**Output**: Sure! Imagine you have a toy robot that listens to what you say and does things like answering questions or telling stories. But, this robot doesn't always understand exactly what you want unless you say it in a certain way.
Prompt engineering is like figuring out the best way to talk to the robot so it does exactly what you want. For example, if you want the robot to tell a funny story about a cat, you might need to say, "Tell me a funny story about a cat," instead of just "Tell me a story."
In short, prompt engineering is about asking the right questions or giving the right instructions to make sure the robot gives you the best answers!
**Notes**: Focused on clear, concise instructions. Output was structured and relevant.

## Prompt 4: IMPROVED PROMPT INPUT
**Prompt**: "What is 923 * 99?
            Let's go step by step.
            Always write out the full number of 0s for each term."
**Output**: To multiply 923 by 99, we can break it down into smaller steps:
Step 1: Write out the full number of 0s for each term: 923 * 99 = 923 * 990
Step 2: Multiply the first term by 9: 923 * 9 = 8307
Step 3: Multiply the first term by 90 (adding one 0): 923 * 90 = 83070
Step 4: Add the results from step 2 and step 3: 8307 + 83070 = 91377
Therefore, 923 multiplied by 99 is equal to 91,377.
**Notes**: Used a step-by-step breakdown strategy to simplify mental math. Emphasized writing out full zeros to reinforce place value understanding and clarity in multi-digit multiplication.

## Prompt 5: MARKETING SUMMARY
**Prompt**: "Write a 100-word marketing summary for an AI tool called TaskBot, which automates repetitive tasks for small businesses in industries like retail and healthcare. Highlight efficiency and cost savings."
